Life History
============

Spotted Seatrout are distributed throughout Florida’s bays and coastal waters. Studies indicate that Spotted Seatrout from various areas of Florida become more genetically isolated from one another as their geographic separation increases (Ramsey and Wakeman 1987, Gold et al. 1999). Recent results (e.g. Seyoum et al. 2014; 2018) from a re-analysis of genetic structure in Florida show the presence of three genetic stocks: 1) a western Gulf stock from South Padre Island, TX to Fort Walton, FL; 2) a Florida Gulf stock from Apalachicola Bay, FL to Biscayne Bay, FL; and 3) an Atlantic stock from Sebastian Inlet, FL to Morehead, NC. Each area may have localized groups of fish that do not intermix regularly with other groups and thus may only be affected by local fishing pressure. Growth is sex- and area-specific with male growth slower. Maximum ages reached in Florida are 9 years for males and 8 years for females. Spotted Seatrout first spawn between 0 and 2 years old and 11.8–15.7 inches total length (TL). Spawning occurs within estuaries and in nearshore waters during spring, summer, and fall. The diet of juvenile seatrout (&lt;1.2 inches SL) includes amphipods, mysids, and carideans (Hettler 1989). Larger juveniles and adults feed primarily on shrimp and fish such as Bay Anchovy, Gulf Menhaden, shad, mullet, Sheepshead Minnow, Gulf Toadfish, pipefish, Pinfish, Pigfish, Silver Jenny, Atlantic Croaker, and Spotted Seatrout (Hettler 1989; McMichael and Peters 1989).
